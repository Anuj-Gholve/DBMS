1️⃣ Create Tables with Constraints
-- Branch Table
CREATE TABLE Branch (
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    assets DECIMAL(15,2)
);

-- Account Table
CREATE TABLE Account (
    acc_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES Branch(branch_name)
);

-- Customer Table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_street VARCHAR(100),
    cust_city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Depositor Table
CREATE TABLE Depositor (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    acc_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, acc_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES Customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (acc_no) REFERENCES Account(acc_no)
);

-- Loan Table
CREATE TABLE Loan (
    loan_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES Branch(branch_name)
);

-- Borrower Table
CREATE TABLE Borrower (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    loan_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, loan_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES Customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (loan_no) REFERENCES Loan(loan_no)
);

2️⃣ Find all customers who have both account and loan at bank
SELECT DISTINCT d.cust_name
FROM Depositor d
JOIN Borrower b ON d.cust_name = b.cust_name;

3️⃣ Find all customers who have an account or loan or both at bank
SELECT DISTINCT cust_name
FROM Depositor
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT cust_name
FROM Borrower;

4️⃣ Find all customers who have account but no loan at the bank
SELECT DISTINCT d.cust_name
FROM Depositor d
WHERE d.cust_name NOT IN (SELECT cust_name FROM Borrower);

5️⃣ Find average account balance at 'Wadia College' branch
SELECT AVG(balance) AS avg_balance
FROM Account
WHERE branch_name = 'Wadia College';

6️⃣ Find number of depositors at each branch
SELECT a.branch_name, COUNT(DISTINCT d.cust_name) AS no_of_depositors
FROM Account a
JOIN Depositor d ON a.acc_no = d.acc_no
GROUP BY a.branch_name;
